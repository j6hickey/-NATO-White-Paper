In the van Driest transformation (“Turbulent Boundary Layer in Compressible Fluids,” Journal of the Aeronautical Sciences, Vol.1951, pp145–216), the viscous stress was neglected, whereas in the Trettel and Larsson transformation (“Mean Velocity Scaling for Compressible Wall Turbulence with Heat Transfer,” Physics of Fluids, Vol., 2016, Paper 026102), the Reynolds stress was assumed to cancel out. Recent work by Griffin, Fu, and Moin (“Velocity Transformation for Compressible Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flows with and Without Heat Transfer,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol.118, No.34, 2021, Paper e2111144118) used a quasi-equilibrium assumption between turbulence production and dissipation in the log layer and demonstrated success for a wide variety of canonical flows. However, the extent of quasi-equilibrium is not verified, particularly for noncanonical flows. In this work, an alternate transformation is developed using the semilocal gradient of the van Driest transformed velocity, which is principally tied to the dynamics of vorticity transport in the boundary layer. In addition, a modified stress balance is utilized to directly account for and scale the buffer region. The transformation was benchmarked using a similar dataset as in Griffin et al., and comparable performance was obtained. Moreover, at supercritical pressures, the present transformation is found to produce significantly better collapse than existing works.}, number={4}, journal={AIAA Journal}, author={Younes, Khaled and Hickey, Jean-Pierre}, year={2023}, month=apr, pages={1532–1539}, language={en} }

            Near a solid wall, the mean velocity of an incompressible fluid is a nearly universal function of the distance from the wall when appropriately transformed (nondimensionalized). For high-speed compressible flows, due to the wall-normal variations of density and viscosity, it has not been established how to transform a dimensional velocity profile into a universal profile. We propose a transformation that is more accurate and more broadly applicable than existing approaches. This improvement results from deploying different physical arguments for the two critical subdomains of a boundary layer. The transformation can be used to extend incompressible turbulence models to compressible turbulent flows, such as those encountered by vehicles for high-speed transportation and planetary reentry.
          , 
            In this work, a transformation, which maps the mean velocity profiles of compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows to the incompressible law of the wall, is proposed. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed transformation successfully collapses, without specific tuning, numerical simulation data from fully developed channel and pipe flows, and boundary layers with or without heat transfer. In all these cases, the transformation is successful across the entire inner layer of the boundary layer (including the viscous sublayer, buffer layer, and logarithmic layer), recovers the asymptotically exact near-wall behavior in the viscous sublayer, and is consistent with the near balance of turbulence production and dissipation in the logarithmic region of the boundary layer. The performance of the transformation is verified for compressible wall-bounded flows with edge Mach numbers ranging from 0 to 15 and friction Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 2,000. Based on physical arguments, we show that such a general transformation exists for compressible wall-bounded turbulence regardless of the wall thermal condition.}, number={34}, journal={Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}, author={Griffin, Kevin Patrick and Fu, Lin and Moin, Parviz}, year={2021}, month=aug, pages={e2111144118}, language={en} }

This study considers the canonical zero-pressure gradient, ﬂat-plate, turbulent boundary layer over a massively cooled wall, with transpiration cooling. The simulations are conducted at a lowsubsonic Mach number and we study two transpiration cooling conﬁgurations with uniform and slit injection at various blowing ratios. The DNS and RANS simulation setups are nearly identical. The RANS-based turbulence models perform well in the qualitative estimation of the velocity and thermal boundary layer evolution at low-blowing ratios (F ¼ 0.2 and 0.6%); more signiﬁcant differences are noted at higher blowing ratios (F ¼ 2:0%). The RANS models, especially the Spalart–Allmaras model, over-predict turbulence production near the wall which results in faster growth in the boundary thickness; this error becomes more pronounced at higher blowing ratios. Despite the greater mixing of momentum, the thermal mixing is under-predicted compared to the DNS in the uniform blowing case but over-predicted for the slit case. These results suggest that modeling errors in the temperature distribution due to turbulent thermal ﬂux modeling can be signiﬁcant even if the velocity is correctly modeled.}, number={9}, journal={Physics of Fluids}, author={Bukva, Alexander and Zhang, Kevin and Christopher, Nicholas and Hickey, Jean-Pierre}, year={2021}, month=sep, pages={095114}, language={en} }
